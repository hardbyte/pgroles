//! Promotion: recognising that a policy's new content *is* a reviewed
//! candidate, and gating execution on the approval that candidate carries.
//!
//! Approval never changes a `PostgresPolicy`. Promotion is the ordinary GitOps
//! write — the pull request carrying the same content merges, the GitOps
//! controller updates `PostgresPolicy.spec`, and this module is what recognises
//! the update as the approved candidate.
//!
//! # The safety property
//!
//! > The effects executed are exactly the approved canonical effects,
//! > recomputed under the lock.
//!
//! Nothing here executes anything, and nothing here re-implements execution.
//! When a promotion is recognised and its candidate's plan is `Approved`, this
//! module hands the reconciler *that plan* in place of the policy's own
//! `current_plan_ref`, and the existing approved-plan path takes over
//! unchanged: it recomputes the canonical change digest from the effects the
//! policy would produce right now, against the state it just inspected under
//! both locks, and executes only if that digest equals the one the plan was
//! approved with — with the target identity bound into the digest either way.
//!
//! Adopting the candidate's plan rather than transferring its approval into a
//! freshly-created policy plan is deliberate. Copying an `Approved` condition
//! onto a new object would mean writing an approval no human decided, with a
//! `decidedBy` the operator invented, and would give the operator a code path
//! that manufactures approvals — precisely the authority the plan-decision
//! model exists to deny it. The candidate's plan is already the reviewed
//! artifact: it carries the decision, the `decidedBy`, the approved change
//! digest and the bound target identity. Reusing it means promotion adds no
//! new trusted step at all.
//!
//! # What is *not* a promotion
//!
//! Everything else, and each case is reported rather than silently ignored:
//!
//! - content matching no candidate — the ordinary policy flow, nothing new;
//! - content matching a candidate whose plan is not approved — the ordinary
//!   manual-plan flow, with `PromotedWithoutApproval` on the candidate;
//! - content that changed into something no candidate holds while an approved
//!   candidate is open — the edited-after-approval case, with
//!   `PromotionDigestMismatch` on that candidate and the enforcement gap named
//!   in plain words.
//!
//! See `docs/src/pages/docs/operator-candidates.md` for the behaviour these
//! rules implement.
